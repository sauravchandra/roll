## ❓ Why I'm Building This

I've tried Notion. Google Keep. Hell, even Jira.   
I've set 100 goals.

And yet... life often feels like a loop of undone tasks.

Not because I lack plans,  
but because I don’t follow through.

I needed something that reminded me, relentlessly.  
But not just another notification.  
Something that said:  
**“You said you’d do it. Prove it.”**

At the same time, I’ve often struggled with *why*.  
Why keep showing up? Why do anything at all?

Then I found comfort in the myth of **Sisyphus**  
the idea that the *act itself* is enough.  
That *pushing the boulder* is a form of meaning.

So I’m building **Roll**  
a small, honest app that helps you show up, upload proof, and track your own effort.

## ✨ What Roll Does

- ✅ Set a recurring task or habit
- 📝 Define what "done" means (your own criteria)
- 📸 Upload **proof** (image, video, or text) to mark it complete
- 🔔 Get reminders to stay on track
- 📈 View your streak, effort history, and proof log

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart.”  
> — Albert Camus

Roll isn't about chasing dopamine or crushing productivity.  
It's about showing up - with **proof** - even when it’s hard.  
Even when there’s no end in sight.  
Like Sisyphus, but with a camera.

## 🚀 Built In Public

I'm documenting the journey on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/sauravschandra).  
Follow along. Or better - build your own boulder, and push it with me.
